# lean-svelte-projects
Svelte + Svelte Kit for clean apps...much cleaner than react;

after using react and losing my love for frontend., I tried Svelte today.
I believe I've found my love for frontend again.

This repo will be a portfolio of svelte projects.
<li>
  Project one - guitar market monitor. We'll query the reverb api(?) (not actually sure there is one). Then we'll show the latest sales for the Fender Strat and Gibson Les Paul...
